# sch-memory-game ðŸ‚¡

Simple memory game created without web frameworks or fancy libraries

## Purpose ðŸŒž

To implement a techincal challenge based on these [instructions](instructions.md)

## Development

Navigate to [starter-kit](starter-kit/) and see the [README](starter-kit/README.md)

## Things I did

1. Updated depencies and configuration so the `npm install` and `npm start` commands would work because dependencies were years out of date
1. Implemented a card memory game using a `game` class and a `card` class in plain JavaScript
1. Fetched game data from a server API
1. Implemented a basic scoreboard using plain HTML and JavaScript
1. Basic unit test using Node.js test runner. Run with: `npm test`
1. Basic CSS

## To do

1. Logic bugfixes in the game - use timing after two non matching cards are selected to block the game until some seconds pass then flip the cards back
1. Refactoring and cleanup
1. CSS to make it more pretty and some fancy animations
